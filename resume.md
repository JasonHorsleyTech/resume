# Jason Horsley - Developer

## Summary
I am a full stack web developer in Austin Texas with 11 years experience.
I have worked in many different environments, but feel happiest and most powerful with Laravel and Vue in a small and agile team. I communicate well with design, product, or marketing; But I can also handle longer term self directed work.

## Objectives
My goal is complete financial independence within 10 years. To achieve this, I believe I need to stay relevant and powerful in a strong open sourced framework, and happy on any given work day to avoid early burnout.

My ideal job is full stack Laravel+Vue, where the bulk of my time is spent writing or maintaining actual code.
Personal


## Personal
Outside of software, I enjoy woodworking and playing overly complicated board games. I speak Spanish, and my wife and I have previously enjoyed living abroad in South American.

After the birth of our son in 2020, we both became substantially more boring.
