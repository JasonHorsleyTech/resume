# Jason Horsley - Developer

## Summary
I am a full stack web developer in Austin Texas with 11 years experience.

I have worked in many different environments, but feel happiest and most powerful with Laravel and Vue in a small and agile team. I communicate well with design, product, or marketing; But I can also handle longer term self directed work.

## Experience
### **ShelterLuv** - 2021 to Present
ShelverLuv provides management software to a majority of animal shelters in the United States.

It's a small company with a heavy emphasis on engineering. I was originally hired full stack, but have slowly moved into a more front-end heavy role for the purposes of balance.

The company is based in California, but all workers are remote. We follow a loose agile format with daily standups and tickets on a jira board. We enjoy a very flat management structure. All engineers are experienced and full stack. We often pair up for a larger scale (>3 weeks) projects, but most work is self directed and as such we have a healthy respect for writing and maintaining tests.

#### Responsibilities

* Shelterluv rewrite - Porting the management platform, our main product, from Drupal 8 to a main Livewire stack and a few vue3 micro-spas.
* AdopterLuv - Payment processing, customer account management, and substantial tracking and analytics work for predictive product recommendations.

### **MicroVentures** - 2019 to 2021
MicroVentures is an investment platform focused mainly on RegD and RegCF raises. I worked in a small team of 4 engineers.

The company still operates inside an Austin office space in "The Domain". It was a typical fast paced startup environment, where deadlines were "yesterday" and requirements were "every feature". It was enjoyable for a time and I did learn a lot, but it was a difficult pace to maintain indefinitely.

#### Responsibilities

* MV API - Laravel backend, acting as single source of truth for company
* MV Invest - Investor facing vue spa. Presented offers based on eligibility, sold long term investments, gave regular portfolio updates.
* MV Manager - Internal platform for other teams in office (customer relations, due dilligence, marketing, and investor vetting teams).
* MV Native - Stripped down version of MV invest, ported to VueNative for mobile iOS app

### **Pubbly** - 2019 to 2015
Pubbly was an experimental offshoot of an established New York book publishing house. It was an attempt to quickly and cheaply digitize their owned intellectual properties, and bring childrens' education into the modern age.

Our main focus was on the Global Learning XPrize competition, an Elon Musk charity project to further education in historically empoverished countries. Our open sourced entry allowed for rapid creation of interactive e-book templates, which could then be duplicated, translated, packaged and delivered via custom android system images.

I was the only fulltime developer during most of the project. The workplace environment could best be described as "injecting literal gallons of black coffee into my veins". It was fun and rewarding, I am ultimately proud of what we were able to accomplish, and I never want to attempt something like it again.

#### Responsibilities

* Pubbly Design Tools - Desktop design tools that allowed non-developers to create custom gamified ebook experiences.
* Pubbly Engine - Custom JS runtime environment to run gamefied ebooks.
* Pubbly Console - CMS focused on translation, localization, and packaging books into andrid deployable structured lesson plans.
* Pubbly Market - An attempted subdomainable storefront licensed to US school districts.

### CCINY - 2011 to 2015
Curriculum Concepts International is a publishing house, focusing on educational content for children. I was originally hired as a bug tester for a contracted project, but brought on full time after the project ended.

My job description was "catchall software guy". I developed and maintained some wordpress sites and internal company servers. I did some prototype game development using GameMaker8, Construct2, and Unity. I additionally developed a custom ePub3 compliant test maker.

I toyed around with the idea of desktop design tools where you could scan a book, draw hidden actionable links, chain a sequence of events, and cheaply turn the original book into an interactive experience. This idea eventually became Pubbly.

#### Responsibilities

* Site admin - Add/maintain anything to their wordpress main page.
* Game developer - Prototype different ideas for educational games.
* Quiz exporter - Prototyped a custom desktop app to design simple quizes and eventually export to an ePub3 compliant online format.

## Objectives
My goal is complete financial independence within 10 years. To achieve this, I believe I need to stay relevant and powerful in a strong open sourced framework, and happy on any given work day to avoid early burnout.

My ideal job is full stack Laravel+Vue, where the bulk of my time is spent writing or maintaining actual code.

## Personal
Outside of software, I enjoy wordworking and playing overly complicated board games. I speak Spanish, and my wife and I have previously enjoyed living abroad in South American.

After the birth of our 2 year old son, we both became substantially more boring.
