            CCI NY is a traditional publishing house. Their main source of revenue continues to be the licencing of
            their proprietary educational content, and the sale of the physical books.

            I was hired as a general web developer in their attempt to modernize. I worked on a project they did for
            McGraw Hill converting old flash based games to HTML5. I acted as their site manager, maintaining and
            improving their wordpress based homepage. I also wrote a web app to convert raw textbook lesson+quiz modules
            into SCORM compliant javascript quizlets.
