            I am currently employed as a full stack developer, working on any and all company code. The MicroVentures
            codebase consists of a client facing investment platform, an in house management console, a native IOS app,
            an electron based 'secure document storage' desktop application, a covid relief charity site, a zendesk help
            center and a wordpress marketing site.

            Most of the projects are Laravel and Vue, one is Scala and React, all communicate with a centralized MySQL
            database via a dedicated API server. Our CSS libraries are fragmented between Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind,
            and hand written scss. We are attempting to unify to a single tailwind install. We have excellent back end
            test coverage, and are working to develop a cypress driven front end test suite to match.
