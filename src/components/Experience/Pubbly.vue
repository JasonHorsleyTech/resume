            Pubbly was a startup bankrolled by CCI-NY. The original vision was a simple desktop application to be used
            by in-house artists and authors, to modernize much of the parent organization's content library. After
            initial development, the tools were used to create a winning entry in the Global Learning Xprize
            competition. The Xprize was a contest to see who could best teach Swahili literacy to native Tanzania
            children using android tablets. We won a cash prize, and were able to field test our submission during an 18
            month trial run.

            I worked to create and improve the Pubbly code base from day one. Their content authoring environment was a
            desktop application written in LiveCode. It exported XML files which could be read and interpreted as
            "interactive books" via our javascript engine. The books were managed by a custom LAMP content management
            system. That in-house management tool was used to structure, map, and bundle each "interactive book" into
            cordova wrapped android applications, and was later retooled to manage external Laravel "marketplace"
            applications we sold to partner companies.

        <p>I managed two other full time developers, and was responsible for all production code</p>
