            I am a web developer based out of Austin Texas. I have been writing code full time since 2012. Most of those
            years have been remote, working by myself or in a very small team.

            I can effectively communicate with designers, management, or end users. I can also take decent personal
            notes during meetings and collaborate with third party companies. But I am at my best and happiest when
            writing actual code to solve the actual problems at hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am most at home in Laravel, Vue and Tailwind.
