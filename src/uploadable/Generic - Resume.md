# Jason Horsley - Developer

## Summary
I am a full stack web developer in Austin Texas with 11 years experience.

I have worked in many different environments, but feel happiest and most powerful with Laravel and Vue in a small and agile team. I communicate well with design, product, or marketing; But I can also handle longer term self directed work.

## Experience
### **ShelterLuv** - Full Stack Engineer, 2021 to Present

Based in California but operating in a remote-first model, ShelterLuv dominates the U.S. market as the go-to Software as a Service (SaaS) solution for animal shelter management. I was initially hired for the commerce team but quickly transitioned into a flexible, full-stack role, addressing engineering needs across multiple departments. 

Our engineering culture operates on a flat organizational structure, adhering to a loose Agile methodology that involves daily standups and issue tracking via JIRA. We value autonomous work but also engage in pair programming for large-scale projects exceeding three weeks in duration. Maintaining robust test suites is an acknowledged best practice within our team.

#### **Key Contributions**

* **ShelterLuv Rewrite**: Spearheaded the migration of the core management platform from Drupal 8 to a Livewire stack, incorporating Vue3 micro-SPAs to enhance modular scalability.
* **AdopterLuv**: Orchestrated end-to-end payment processing and customer account management functionalities, while implementing sophisticated tracking and analytics for predictive product recommendations.

### **Pubbly** - 2019 to 2015
Pubbly was an experimental offshoot of an established New York book publishing house. It was an attempt to quickly and cheaply digitize their owned intellectual properties, and bring childrens' education into the modern age.

Our main focus was on the Global Learning XPrize competition, an Elon Musk charity project to further education in historically empoverished countries. Our open sourced entry allowed for rapid creation of interactive e-book templates, which could then be duplicated, translated, packaged and delivered via custom android system images.

I was the only fulltime developer during most of the project. The workplace environment could best be described as "injecting literal gallons of black coffee into my veins". It was fun and rewarding, I am ultimately proud of what we were able to accomplish, and I never want to attempt something like it again.

#### Responsibilities

* Pubbly Design Tools - Desktop design tools that allowed non-developers to create custom gamified ebook experiences.
* Pubbly Engine - Custom JS runtime environment to run gamefied ebooks.
* Pubbly Console - CMS focused on translation, localization, and packaging books into andrid deployable structured lesson plans.
* Pubbly Market - An attempted subdomainable storefront licensed to US school districts.

### CCINY - 2011 to 2015
Curriculum Concepts International is a publishing house, focusing on educational content for children. I was originally hired as a bug tester for a contracted project, but brought on full time after the project ended.

My job description was "catchall software guy". I developed and maintained some wordpress sites and internal company servers. I did some prototype game development using GameMaker8, Construct2, and Unity. I additionally developed a custom ePub3 compliant test maker.

I toyed around with the idea of desktop design tools where you could scan a book, draw hidden actionable links, chain a sequence of events, and cheaply turn the original book into an interactive experience. This idea eventually became Pubbly.

#### Responsibilities

* Site admin - Add/maintain anything to their wordpress main page.
* Game developer - Prototype different ideas for educational games.
* Quiz exporter - Prototyped a custom desktop app to design simple quizes and eventually export to an ePub3 compliant online format.

## Objectives
My goal is complete financial independence within 10 years. To achieve this, I believe I need to stay relevant and powerful in a strong open sourced framework, and happy on any given work day to avoid early burnout.

My ideal job is full stack Laravel+Vue, where the bulk of my time is spent writing or maintaining actual code.

## Personal
Outside of software, I enjoy wordworking and playing overly complicated board games. I speak Spanish, and my wife and I have previously enjoyed living abroad in South American.

After the birth of our 2 year old son, we both became substantially more boring.
