## Experience
### ShelterLuv - Full Stack Engineer, 2021 to Present

California-based but operating with a remote-first culture, ShelterLuv leads in animal shelter management software. Initially onboarded to commerce team, later pivoted to a multi-disciplinary engineering role.

#### Organizational Dynamics
Flat hierarchy governed by Agile principles, daily scrums, and JIRA issue tracking. Regularly engage in pair programming for complex, multi-week initiatives. Maintain comprehensive test suites as a standard protocol.

#### Key Contributions

* **Platform Migration**: Spearheaded the migration of the core management platform from Drupal 8 to a Livewire stack, integrating Vue3 micro-SPAs to elevate modular design and higher deliverability.
  * **Kennel Card Builder**: Created a Vue3 SPA for designing print-friendly kennel cards, offering direct canvas and DOM manipulation.
  * **Application Manager**: Vue3 spa and *very lite* backend, allowing shelter workers to prioritize and process "adoption applications". Our attempt to collect additional user data pre-checkout (monetization step).
* **AdopterLuv**: Engineered a comprehensive payment and customer account management system, incorporating predictive analytics for product recommendations
* **Payment Processor**: Co-developed a PHP Composer package to transition from Stripe to Stax without eliminating Stripe as a fallback option.

### MicroVentures - Software Engineer, 2019 to 2021

Austin-based crowdfunding investment platform, focused on Reg D and Reg CF offerings.

Located at The Domain in Austin, MicroVentures operates as an accredited and crowdfunding investment platform with a primary focus on Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding investment opportunities. I was a pivotal member of a lean, four-person engineering team. Our environment epitomized startup culture: high-velocity, feature-rich, and deadline-driven.

## Organizational Dynamics
We had a lean four-person engineering team, and about twice as many stacks to support. We were all cramped into a medium size private office, constantly scooting to someone elses monitor or drawing squares on a dirty window.

#### Key Contributions

* **API Architecture**: Developed and sustained the Laravel-based API, serving as the organization's data backbone.
* **Investment Portal**: Designed a responsive SPA with Vue.js to dynamically sell investment opportunities based on eligibility criteria, provided real-time portfolio analytics, and facilitate exits.
* **Operational Hub**: Engineered an all-in-one internal management system to optimize CRM, due diligence, and marketing workflows.
* **MV Native**: Pioneered a mobile-responsive iteration of the investment portal using Vue Native, and later Swift.

## Personal

#### Goal
My career objective is financial independence within a decade, leveraging in-depth skills and open-sourced tooling.

#### Life
Outside of software, I host game night, where I and the other neighborhood dads drink and play overly complicated board games. I also play accordion for a very unprofessional sea-shanty quartet.

I used to live in Mexico with my wife, but after two kids we became substantially more boring.
