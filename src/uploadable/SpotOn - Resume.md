# Experience

## ShelterLuv - Full Stack Engineer, 2021 to Present

## MicroVentures - Software Engineer, 2019 to 2021

Austin-based crowdfunding investment platform, focused on Reg D and Reg CF offerings.

Located at The Domain in Austin, MicroVentures operates as an accredited and crowdfunding investment platform with a primary focus on Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding investment opportunities. I was a pivotal member of a lean, four-person engineering team. Our environment epitomized startup culture: high-velocity, feature-rich, and deadline-driven.

#### Organizational Dynamics
We had a lean four-person engineering team, and about twice as many stacks to support. We were all cramped into a medium size private office, constantly scooting to someone elses monitor or drawing squares on a dirty window.

#### Key Contributions

* **API Architecture**: Developed and sustained the Laravel-based API, serving as the organization's data backbone.
* **Investment Portal**: Designed a responsive SPA with Vue.js to dynamically sell investment opportunities based on eligibility criteria, provided real-time portfolio analytics, and facilitate exits.
* **Operational Hub**: Engineered an all-in-one internal management system to optimize CRM, due diligence, and marketing workflows.
* **MV Native**: Pioneered a mobile-responsive iteration of the investment portal using Vue Native, and later Swift.

## Lessons

#### Be kind, not nice.

At Pubbly, I had the responsibility to manage an outsourced developer from the Philippines. While initial progress was smooth, the developer began to lag in productivity. Instead of confronting the issue head-on and providing targeted guidance, I chose to sidestep the issue to avoid conflict. He missed his deadlines and ultimately lost the job. The lesson: I purchased the luxury of "I don't want to upset him" at his own expense.

Choose kindness over mere niceness.

#### Data talks

At MicroVentures, we moved from Laravel monolith to a SPA and API. Hooking into vue-router and axios, all requests and navigation events were logged. Using only a few tables, we could reconstruct complete site journeys.

This level of granular tracking was absent when I transitioned ot Shelterluv, a startup with a less mature stack and fragmented tracking systems. Bugs were harder to isolate, slower to surface, and twice the time investment to fix.

We got approval for a "2 sprint rework". We prioritized tracking. A few months post release, it's clear the investment has paid off, and will only continue to compound.

#### There's more than you think

At MicroVentures, one of my early tasks was to decouple Vue pages from a Laravel monolith to create a SPA. Initial estimates were optimistic: "No more than a month," we said. I was excited to get started.

As I dug in, I discovered forgotten, yet critical, features that had complex backend dependencies. Each discovery inflated the timeline, turning my 'one-month' project into a two-month ordeal.

The lesson here is twofold: 

* First, no 5 year old codebase is "simple". There are features the owner hasn't thought about in years, but once reminded, won't be able to live without. An in-depth audit before writing the first line of code is non-negotiable.
* Second, if the initial scoping feels protracted, consider it a red flag that the project is under-budgeted. Scoping is an early warning system.

## Personal

#### Goal
My career objective is financial independence within a decade, leveraging in-depth skills and open-sourced tooling.

#### Life
Outside of software, I host game night, where I and the other neighborhood dads drink and play overly complicated board games. I also play accordion for a very unprofessional sea-shanty quartet.

I used to live in Latin America with my wife, but after two kids we became substantially more boring.
