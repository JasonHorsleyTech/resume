#### Be kind, not nice.

At pubbly, we needed some extra help. I was given a small stipend, enough to hire a full time outsourced developer in the Philippines.

Timezones made it hard to connect, one of us had to stay up late for a face to face. He mentioned he was uncomfortable with it, so we primarily used a slack channel. At first work went fine, he would do what I asked. After a month or so, I gave him a larger project with less structure.

I focused on my own work for a while. When I finally checked back in, he was far from a deliverable. He had spent far too long worrying about the "design" of it all, especially considering it was just supposed to be an in house tool. And even factoring in the extra polish, it felt like his speed was much much slower than where we started. Instead of calling him up and having a frank conversation, I said something close to "Looks great! Just a reminder, we can only afford another 3-4 weeks on this." I spent those weeks locked in my comfort zone (my own IDE on my own task).

The deadline came and went. I had a call with the company owner, who WAS frank, who DID directly ask about the new hire's performance, which I said had dropped. I was told to let him go on the spot.

Obviously, I should have had a more gradual build up, been more hands on with initial estimates, had more frequent checkups.

But I think my ultimate failure was: I purchased the luxury of "I don't want to upset him" at his expense.

I should have been kinder. Actually cared about his position. I was "nice" instead, and he lost his job because of it.

Be kind, not nice.

#### Data talks

At MicroVentures, we moved from Laravel monolith to a SPA and API. We were able to hook into vue-router and axios, and log basically every click and request for all users. Small bugs would surface, and using those tracking tables we could recreate the exact path the user took through the site. It was an incredibly useful tool.

I then moved to Shelterluv. Their stacks were much earlier in the start-up phase, and while some tracking had been implemented, sometimes multiple different conflicting tracking systems on the same site, we had limited coverage.

Not only are bugs harder to narrow down, issues take longer to surface.
